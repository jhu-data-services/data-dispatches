This is useful if you want your figures to use a consistent style.\nMaybe you frequently submit to a specific journal which has an explicit style guide, and you want to ensure your figures are consistent with that style guide.\nIt can be a lot of work, and a lot of code to get the aesthetics of your ggplot2 figure just right. Instead of changing the font type, size, coloring, etc. every time you create a plot, just create a theme, that can then be applied to every new figure you create!\nLet’s create a plot using the default style in ggplot2, and explore some of the default themes to get a better understanding of what a ggplot2 theme looks like, and how it’s structured."

This is the theme that is used when you call ggplot without specifying a theme.\nWhen we compare penguin flipper length to penguin body mass by species the plot created uses theme_gray():\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g,\n                            y = flipper_length_mm,\n                            color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") +\n  ylab(\"Flipper Length (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can explicitly add the theme and see that nothing changes:\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g,\n                            y = flipper_length_mm,\n                            color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") +\n  ylab(\"Flipper Length (mm)\") +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging theme\nBut if we change the theme, we see our scatter plot change accordingly. Let’s use theme_minimal():\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g,\n                            y = flipper_length_mm,\n                            color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") +\n  ylab(\"Flipper Length (mm)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable themes\nThere are a number of themes available in ggplot2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntheme_gray()\nThe signature ggplot2 theme with a grey background and white gridlines, designed to put the data forward yet make comparisons easy.\n\n\ntheme_bw()\nThe classic dark-on-light ggplot2 theme. May work better for presentations displayed with a projector.\n\n\ntheme_linedraw()\nA theme with only black lines of various widths on white backgrounds, reminiscent of a line drawing. Serves a purpose similar to theme_bw(). Note that this theme has some very thin lines (<< 1 pt) which some journals may refuse.\n\n\ntheme_light()\nA theme similar to theme_linedraw() but with light grey lines and axes, to direct more attention towards the data.\n\n\ntheme_dark()\nThe dark cousin of theme_light(), with similar line sizes but a dark background. Useful to make thin coloured lines pop out.\n\n\ntheme_minimal()\nA minimalistic theme with no background annotations.\n\n\ntheme_classic()\nA classic-looking theme, with x and y axis lines and no gridlines.\n\n\ntheme_void()\nA completely empty theme.\n\n\ntheme_test()\nA theme for visual unit tests. It should ideally never change except for new features."
